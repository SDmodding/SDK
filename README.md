> Use the [<kbd>**old**</kbd>](https://github.com/SDmodding/SDK/tree/old) branch to access the old SDK, but keep in mind that it has been abandoned and should be avoided, as it is poorly written.

## Usage
1. Clone repository
2. Use external include or mklink to the folder of SDK
3. Include main header file for SDK <kbd>**sdhd_sdk.hh**</kbd>
4. That's all, now you just going to need to study the whole SDK.
